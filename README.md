# Focus Blocker

A CLI tool to block distracting websites using the NextDNS API, with lockout logic to prevent easy reversal.

## Setup

> [!TIP]
> In order for this tool to work, the following setup steps are required.

1. Create a [NextDNS account](https://my.nextdns.io/) and a new [Apple Configuration Profile](apple.nextdns.io) for your iPhone.

2. Download and install this new configuration profile on your iPhone.

> By downloading the `.mobileconfig` file and clicking on it on your iPhone, you'll see a prompt to navigate to `Settings > General > VPN & Device Management` and install the profile. This gives your iPhone persistent access to the custom DNS settings â€” including the blocklist managed by this CLI.

3. Navigate to your [NextDNS account](https://my.nextdns.io/account) page, and generate a new API key at the bottom of the page.

4. Create a new `.env` file at the root of the directory, referring to the `.env.example` template, and make sure to input your newly generated `NEXTDNS_API_KEY` and `NEXTDNS_PROFILE_ID`.

5. In your terminal, navigate to the root of this directory and install the following dependencies:

```pip install python-dotenv requests```

## Usage

The following are the sample commands that are supported by this CLI:

```py
python cli.py add youtube.com
python cli.py remove facebook.com
python cli.py push --lockout 48
python cli.py status
```
